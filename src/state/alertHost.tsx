// src/state/alertHost.tsx
// Global host for the app's custom alert/confirm UI (replaces the bare OS dialog  window.alert
// /window.confirm on web, the native Alert.alert elsewhere  with one on-brand modal that looks
// the same on every platform). Mirrors GlossaryProvider's shape (a Context holding what's
// currently open + an AppAlertModal render component mounted once near the app root), but adds
// a module-level bridge on top: `notify`/`confirmAction` in lib/platformAlert.ts are plain
// functions called from event handlers all over the app (deletion confirmations, scan-permission
// notices, etc.), not React components, so they can't call a hook. The bridge lets them dispatch
// into whichever AlertHostProvider is currently mounted without every call site needing to
// thread a hook through.
